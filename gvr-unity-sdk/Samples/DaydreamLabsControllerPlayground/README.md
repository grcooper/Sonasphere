## Daydream Labs Controller Playground

Thanks for downloading the source code to Daydream Labs Controller Playground.  The Daydream controller can be used for a very broad range of game mechanics, and it is our hope that these tech demos inspire you to build awesome apps for the platform!

To learn more about designing and developing for the Daydream controller, we recommend you watch this [Google I/O 2016 session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9OfmWnqR0M) from the team that built the controller SDK, as well as these specific demos.

Remember when using the controller emulator app on an Android phone that double tap on the touchpad is equivalent to physically clicking the Daydream controller.  Clicking is used in the app menu to select a demo, as well as several of the demos themselves.

The following demos are included:

### Swinging an object

- Tennis
- Xylophone
- Fishing

### Flicking your wrist

- Magic wand
- Boomerang
- Archeology (this demo also shows inspecting a 3D object that maps itself to the controller)
- Flipping Pancakes

### Object Manipulation

- Marble maze
- Pottery
- 3D Puzzle

### Flying

- Kite
- Dragon

### 3rd Person Character Control

- Collecting coins
- Dragon Team (an RTS style interface with multiple unit drag rectangle selection)
- Ninja
