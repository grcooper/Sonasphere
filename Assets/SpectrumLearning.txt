In this project we want to know more about the spectrum of information we are getting.

These two sites are my references for my new knowledge of the audio spectrum!
http://www.teachmeaudio.com/mixing/techniques/audio-spectrum
http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/making-sense-of-spectrum-data.90262/

Using the first and second links together I will figure out what ranges I can use for different data:

Hz * 0.34133 = index

20-50hz = 6.8 - 17 - Sub bass, difficult to hear

60-250hz = 20.5 - 85.3 - Bass

250-500hz = 85.3 - 170.6 - Low Midrange

500-2k = 170.6 - 682.6 - Midrange

2k-4k = 682.6 - 1365.3 - Upper Midrange

// Below this hurts the ears and I doubt will be in regular music

4k-6k = 1365.3 - 2048 - Presence

6k-20k = 2048 - 6826.6 - Brilliance

Sum these sections and apply them to different places!

What did we change this time/learn about? Aguust 14th 2016
- Learned more about fourier transforms and how the spectrum data is being computed
- added debug lines to visualize the data better
- Added a moving averages smoothing algorithm
- Learned about k-means machine learning clustering algorithm.
	- Next step is to use this algorithm to cluster peaks together and change values of the particles based on those peaks rather than the ranges above
	- this allows for the ability to better change our movients etc based on the song, now if we only have base, we can adjust more values using it.
